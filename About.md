## Data Source

The data include two datasets:

* winequality-red.csv - red wine preference samples
* winequality-white.csv - white wine preference samples

The datasets are available on [UCI Machine Learning Repository website](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Wine+Quality) and here: [winequality.zip](http://www3.dsi.uminho.pt/pcortez/wine/winequality.zip)

The two datasets are related to red and white variants of the [Portuguese "Vinho Verde" wine](http://www.vinhoverde.pt/en/). Due to privacy and logistic issues, only physicochemical (inputs) and sensory (the output) variables are available (e.g. there is no data about grape types, wine brand, wine selling price, etc.). 


## Attribute Information
 
Input variables (based on physicochemical tests): 

1. fixed acidity 
2. volatile acidity 
3. citric acid 
4. residual sugar 
5. chlorides 
6. free sulfur dioxide 
7. total sulfur dioxide 
8. density 
9. pH 
10. sulphates 
11. alcohol 

12. quality (score between 0 and 10) - Output variable
