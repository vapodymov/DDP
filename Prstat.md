## Problem Statement

The aim of this project is to explore the Random Forest technique in predicting of the quality of wines using physicochemical parameters (see "About" section for more details on data used).

In the original dataset the quality of wine is defined as a quantitative variable. In our binary classification problem it is re-defined as a factor variable in the suggestion that if the 'quality' is greater than 6, then we classify this wine as a 'good' one. 

The application contains the following tabs:

* _Data Set_ displays a table with final clean dataset
* _Exploratory Data Analysis_ shows how the quantitative variables normalized to be within the [0,1] range are distributed
* _Random Forest_ demonstrates the results of predicting the quality of wine using the Random Forest classifier (be advised that the classifier requires some time to train models)
* _About_ gives details on the Wine Quality UCI Machine Learning dataset
