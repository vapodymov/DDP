Application Structure
========================================================

The aim of the project is to explore the Random Forest technique in predicting of the quality of wines using physicochemical parameters.

The application has the following tabs:

* _Data Set_ displays a table with final clean dataset
* _Exploratory Data Analysis_ shows how the quantitative variables normalized to be within the [0,1] range are distributed
* _Random Forest_ demonstrates the results of predicting the quality of wine using the Random Forest classifier. A user can select the model parameters using intuitive UI.
* _About_ gives details on the Wine Quality UCI Machine Learning dataset

Data Set
========================================================
Original Data are the [Wine Quality UCI Machine Learning dataset](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Wine+Quality)

```{r, echo=FALSE}
red <- read.csv('http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/wine-quality/winequality-red.csv', header = TRUE, sep = ';')
white <- read.csv('http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/wine-quality/winequality-white.csv', header = TRUE, sep = ';')
red[, 'color'] <- 'red'
white[, 'color'] <- 'white'
wines <- rbind(red, white)
wines$color <- as.factor(wines$color)
```

```{r}
str(wines)
```

Summary
========================================================
The developed program allows a user to:

- Visualize numerical features distribution 
- Set the training set portion and a number of trees in the model
- Preview the accuracy and variables importance
